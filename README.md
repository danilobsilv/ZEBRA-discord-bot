# ZEBRA-discord-bot

- This bot shows info about the the brazilian football championship, using "https://www.api-futebol.com.br" as source
- The bot was developed only by using the discord's lib itself, Discord.py
- The commands are very simple (still working on them)
- The purpose of developing this bot is to learn about two important topics, which are:<br>
      - **Web development**<br>
      - **Task automation**
- The small amount of commands is due to the limited content offered by the API, since I'm using its free version.
